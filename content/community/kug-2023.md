## Hotel Accomodation

Albuquerque is NOT an inherently walkable city, however there are two decent hotels close enough that a car wouldn't be strictly necessary.
Besides those there are many good hotels throughout Albuquerque. Any place *east* of the River (i.e. in Albuquerque proper) will be fine and at most 15-20mins by car.

*We do NOT recommend staying in the nearby Motel6/Studio6!*

#### Home2 Suites by Hilton Albuquerque/Downtown-University

  * *Website:* https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/abqduht-home2-suites-albuquerque-downtown-university/
  * *Price:* ~$125/night

#### Crowne Plaza Albuquerque

  * *Website:* https://www.ihg.com/crowneplaza/hotels/us/en/albuquerque/abqcp
  * *Price:* ~$115/night

#### Other Recommended Areas

  * Uptown - several hotels in walking distance to restaurants and shops for example:
    * Marriott Albuquerque: https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/abqnm-marriott-albuquerque/overview/
    * Homewood Suites by Hilton: https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/abqhwhw-homewood-suites-albuquerque-uptown/
    * Sheraton Albuquerque Uptown: https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/abqsi-sheraton-albuquerque-uptown/

## Transportation

  * The Albuquerque Airport (Sunport) is about 15-20 mins by car to central Albuqerque.
  * We do not recommend public transportation in Albuquerque.
  * Ride services are readily available.
  * Parking is ubiquitous and free, so rental cars are a convenient method to get around.
