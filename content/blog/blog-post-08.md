# Scientific Software Milestone

Kokkos and five other US Department of Energy (DOE) projets anchor the [Linux High-Performance Software Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-launch-of-the-high-performance-software-foundation), setting the stage for long-term sustainability and global collaboration.
This first-of-its-kind achievement for US DOE software projects was the result of nearly two years' intense effort to make the vision a reality.
Christian Trott, the Kokkos technical lead, enthused, "I am more than excited to see where this goes, and hope that this step will encourage more institutions to contribute to the development and support of Kokkos and other projects in HPSF!"
Kokkos' and the other projects' success were enabled by massive US DOE investments in [exascale computing](https://www.exascaleproject.org/). 


# Kokkos Is Open for Global Business

Key benefits of belonging to the Linux Foundation High-Performance Software Foundation include open governance models, resources for improving software quality and building community, as well as the association with the larger Linux computing ecosystem.
Kokkos welcomes all manner of high-quality contribution -- from fixes and features, to build system upgrades, and even pioneering capabilities in new domains.
If you feel inspired to contribute, please reach out on the [Kokkos Slack Channel](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/faq.html) to discuss.    


# Impacts, Benefits for Kokkos Users, Developers

Kokkos developers and users will likely experience, few, if any, change in their day-to-day activities, but over the longer term, will realize the benefits of improved software, open governance, resources for community building, and world-wide collaboration.
